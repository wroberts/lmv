## Description

I'm reposting a little OpenGL program I made years ago, along with some images it can generate. Sierpinksi gasket:

I think I originally wrote this for fun, but I ended up using it for an undergraduate computer science presentation.

## Building

The project uses the [GNU Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) as a build system, so building should work with `./configure ; make`.
